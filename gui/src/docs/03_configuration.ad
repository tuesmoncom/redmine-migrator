== Configuration

=== Redmine

To use the Redmine Rest API you need to connect to your Redmine instance as an _Administrator user_ and go to `Administration -> Settings -> Authentication` and enable the option `Enable REST web service`.

IMPORTANT: Unfortunately the migration process needs to be done with the Redmine administrator user because the migrator needs to get the email of the users to assign them the issues, comments,... and it is only expose for administrators.

Go to your Redmine profile page and copy the `API access key` because it is the credentials you will need to login into Redmine Rest API.

Then you can go to the migrator `Project -> Settings` and fill the form with your Redmine info:

* `Address`: The url where Redmine instance is available
* `ApiKey`: The Api access key you've already copied from Redmine
* `Timeout`: If your Redmine instance is in a very slow network you may
need to change this setting to a higher value. This value should be
set in milliseconds.

=== Tuesmon

Go to `Project -> Settings` and fill the form with your Redmine and Tuesmon credentials

NOTE: Please note that you can use any Tuesmon instance to migrate your projects. For example, if you want to migrate to the hosted Tuesmon environment you need to use `https://api.tuesmon.com` as Tuesmon address.
