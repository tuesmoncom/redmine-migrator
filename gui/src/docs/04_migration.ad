Open _Tuesmon_ projects in `Projects -> Tuesmon Projects` and you can check that the project has been migrated.

Please check the log for errors and warnings during the migration process.

Sometimes could be useful to export the log. In the `Log window` there
are two buttons, one to clear the log and another one to export what
is in the log so far.

By default the log will be exported to the user
home directory with a name like 'tuesmon_migrator_[timestamp].log`.
