== Limitations and known issues

You need to keep in mind that the migration process is not perfect because Redmine and Tuesmon features don't fully overlap each other.

You also need to check that your Redmine version expose in http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Rest_api[the REST API^] all the objects that are going to be migrated. For example, until Redmine 2.2 the Wikipages aren't exposed by the REST Api.

In the following sections we explain the migration decisions for every element in Redmine.


=== Projects

The projects are migrated with the same name and description as in Redmine. A new slug is created to avoid name colisions with other users. You can modify all these values in `Admin -> Project profile -> Project details`.


=== Users

We made the decision of do not migrate users. The users must previously exist in Tuesmon before the migration with the same email as in Redmine. During the migration process we use the email of the users to asign them as the owner of an issue, the comments,...


=== Issues

All the issues of the projects are migrated to Tuesmon and the Redmine trackers, priorities and status are also migrated.
For every issue besides the basic data we migrate the comments, attachments and assigned user.


=== Wiki

Wikis are one of those cases where the migration is not perfect. Redmine supports different markup languages such as `textile` or `reStructuredText`. Tuesmon wikis are written in `Markdown` so you might need to fix some formats after the migration.
Besides the text of the wikipages, all the attachments are also migrated to the wikipages.

Another important thing is that in Tuesmon the main wiki page is called `Home` and in Redmine, by default it is `Wiki`. Even so it's possible to change the default wiki page in Redmine. As Redmine API doesn't expose the name of the default wiki page we try to figure it out which is the default page. We try with `home` or `wiki` and if none of these pages exists in Redmine, we set the oldest page as the new home page.


=== Files

Currently Redmine does not expose the files in the REST API, so it is not possible to migrate them.


=== Documents

Currently Redmine does not expose the documents in the REST API, so it is not possible to migrate them.


=== Sprints, User stories and Tasks

All the issues in Redmine are migrated to issues in Tuesmon, so after the migration the backlog will be empty. We use in Redmine http://www.redminebacklogs.net/[the backlogs plugin] for scrum.
For the next major release of the migrator we're going to migrate the sprints, user stories and tasks of the Redmine Backlogs plugin to Sprints, User stories and Tasks in Tuesmon.
